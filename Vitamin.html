                      There are lots of great vitamin C foods for kids! Vitamin C is a helpful antioxidant, it‚Äôs great for their skin, bones, and connective tissues, and it can help them absorb other important nutrients, like iron. And, as long as they‚Äôre getting enough each day, it can provide immune support.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      But how much Vitamin C do kids need each day? Can they get enough from toddler-friendly foods, or should you be serving fortified orange juice on the daily? And what about Vitamin C supplements? In today‚Äôs post, I‚Äôll get you the answers you need. And together, we‚Äôll make sure they get the Vitamin C they need! (Orange you glad you found this article?! üòú)

                    <h2>What Is Vitamin C?</h2>
                    <p>
                      Also known as ascorbic acid, Vitamin C is something all kids (and adults) need. But, not all vitamins are the same. And they‚Äôre not all required in the same amounts. So let‚Äôs get specific!

Like most vitamins, Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, which means it can be dissolved in water. Being water-soluble is a good thing because, once it‚Äôs been consumed, Vitamin C can be easily transported to the tissues in your child‚Äôs body that need it most. But, it‚Äôs less ideal in that it cannot be stored by your child‚Äôs body long-term. (Vitamins A, D, E, and K are the only ones that are fat-soluble instead of water-soluble. They can be stored in the liver and fat tissues in the body for longer-term use!) Vitamin C also can‚Äôt be produced by the body‚Äîwe all need to get our Vitamin C from food. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This lack of long-term storage paired with the fact that the body can‚Äôt produce Vitamin C means your child needs to get enough of this vitamin every day through food to be sure there‚Äôs enough in their body at all times to go around.
                    </p>
                   <h2> What Does Vitamin C Do In The Body?</h2>
                   <p>
                    When you think of Vitamin C, you probably think of something that you take or try to get more of when you have a cold, right? Well, there‚Äôs a good reason for that! Vitamin C does help give us more immune support. But, it does a lot more than that, too!

                   </p>
                   <p>Vitamin C‚Ä¶</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li> Is an antioxidant</li>
                    <li> Helps maintain our skin, bones, and connective tissues through something called collagen synthesis</li>
                    <li>Provides immune support (You knew this already, didn‚Äôt you?!) </li>
                    <li>Increases our ability to absorb iron (Fun fact: If you‚Äôve been told to take iron supplements with a Vitamin C supplement, this is why!) </li>
                    
                   </ul>
                   <p>
                    It‚Äôs a great idea to make sure your family is getting enough Vitamin C in their diets. But, it‚Äôs not something you need to stress about too much. We‚Äôre about to get into how much Vitamin C your child needs‚Äîand how to get it into them. And as you‚Äôll see, it‚Äôs super doable!
                   </p>

                
                    <h2>How Much Vitamin C Do Kids Need Each Day?</h2>
                    <p>
                     When we talk about how much of a vitamin or mineral a child or adult needs, we dietitians and health professionals tend to drop all kinds of acronyms, like RDA, AI, and UL. These are called ‚ÄòDietary Reference Intakes‚Äô and they help determine how much of everything individuals get or should be getting‚Ä¶but, if you‚Äôre not familiar with them, they can be confusing, too!

                    <br>So before we talk about Vitamin C requirements specifically, let‚Äôs clear these up and make sure you and I are for sure on the same page.
                    </p>
                    <h6>RDA: Recommended Dietary Allowance</h6>
                    <p>The average daily intake you need to meet the requirements for any given nutrient. This number will be accurate for up to 98% of people you‚Äôd describe as ‚Äòhealthy.‚Äô</p>

                    <h6>AI: Adequate Intake</h6>

                    <p>Think of this number as what‚Äôs ‚Äúenough‚Äù based on either studies or approximations. This is based on studies or approximations of what appears to be adequate in healthy populations. AI is used when there is not enough information for an RDA.</p>

                    <h6>UL: Tolerable Upper Intake Level</h6>

                    <p>This is the highest amount of a nutrient you can likely consume without negative health risks. (You‚Äôre good if you get this amount of a given nutrient or less!)</p>

                    <p>Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, these terms are all scientifically useful in determining optimal vitamin and mineral intake. But you don‚Äôt need to remember them all! I mostly want you to know the RDA (the minimum amount of Vitamin C they need each day) and the UL (how much is too much).</p>

                    <h6>Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) for Vitamin C in Kids</h6>
                    <p>According to the National Institutes of Health‚Äôs Office of Dietary Supplements, these are the minimum amounts of Vitamin C your child will need to consume each day, based on their age:</p>
                    <h2>
                      Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) for Vitamin C in Kids
                    </h2>
                    <p>According to the National Institutes of Health‚Äôs Office of Dietary Supplements, these are the minimum amounts of Vitamin C your child will need to consume each day, based on their age:</p>
                    <div class="content-image right-aligned">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                      Side effects of having too much Vitamin C in children are digestive discomfort, diarrhea, and nausea. And, they can potentially develop kidney stones. But ‚Äútoo much‚Äù is a LOT‚Äîthe upper levels you see here are much higher than the recommended daily allowances listed above. And, because Vitamin C is water-soluble, the excess your child consumed will get excreted in their urine. So if your child gets more than the RDA of Vitamin C‚Äîas long as it‚Äôs not a TON more in a short period of time‚Äîyou shouldn‚Äôt need to worry.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Vitamin C Is Easy To Get</h2>
                    <p>
                      The good news is that these numbers are extremely easy to reach with a diet that‚Äôs even somewhat balanced and includes some kind of daily fruit and veggies. Breastfed and formula-fed babies get enough Vitamin C from breastmilk and/or formula, so there‚Äôs no need to supplement there.

                      <br>You may need to be intentional about your child getting enough Vitamin C if you have a picky eater‚Äîespecially if they‚Äôre not big on fruits and veggies. But overall, Vitamin C deficiencies are pretty rare, and that‚Äôs because this vitamin is so readily available in so many foods.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Vitamin C Foods For Kids</h2>
                    <p>
                      By now, you know that your child needs Vitamin C and that they need to get it from food. But what does 25 or 50 mg of Vitamin C look like in real life?! Let‚Äôs get you some examples. 

                      <br>And remember, a 1 to 3 year old only needs 15 mg per day; a 4 to 8 year old needs 25 mg per day.

                    <h2>Vitamin C: How Much Is Too Much For Kids?</h2>
                    <p>
                      The numbers we‚Äôve listed above are Recommended Daily Allowances‚Äîthey‚Äôre the minimum amounts of Vitamin C most children need for optimal health. But is there such thing as too much Vitamin C? In short, yes, there is such thing as too much Vitamin C‚Äîalso known as Upper Limits of Vitamin C, which we‚Äôve sourced from the National Institutes of Health‚Äôs Vitamin C Fact Sheet for Consumers:
                    </p>
                  </div>
                   <h2>Vegetables with Vitamin C</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Bell peppers (45 mg per ¬º cup)</li>
                      <li>Broccoli (30 mg per ¬º cup)</li>
                      <li>Cauliflower (25 mg per ¬Ω cup)</li>
                      <li>Brussels sprouts (74.8 mg per 1 cup)</li>
                    </ul>
                     <h2>Other Sources of Vitamin C</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Fruit juices, like orange juice (50 mg per ¬Ω cup)</li>
                      <li>Potatoes (42 mg per medium potato)</li>
                      <li>Foods fortified with Vitamin C</li>
                      <li>Vitamin C Supplements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Are any of these vitamin C foods for kids ones that your little one eats regularly?</p>
                    <h2>When To Give Your Child A Vitamin C Supplement </h2>
                    <p>Because Vitamin C is in so many foods, it‚Äôs usually pretty easy to meet their recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C with food. Babies get enough from breastmilk or formula alone, and once they start solids or purees, half a cup of steamed veggies does the trick. Toddlers can meet their RDA with half an orange or half a cup of mango. And preschoolers only need a little kiwi or a quarter cup of peppers and dip to do it! So, in most cases, a Vitamin C supplement isn‚Äôt necessary. But there are a few instances where it might be.</p>
                    <h2>Consider a Vitamin C Supplement If‚Ä¶</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Your child is a severely picky eater</li>
                      <li>Your child has been diagnosed with digestive issues</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Vitamin C supplements come in both gummy or liquid forms, and Vitamin C is usually included in multivitamins. Just remember to always consult with your child‚Äôs pediatrician before you begin supplementing their diet, and whenever you think they may have a need for additional Vitamin C!</p>
                    <h2>Can Vitamin C Supplements prevent a cold?</h2>
                    <p>It is well established in the research that taking vitamin C supplements will not prevent a cold. It is possible that regular vitamin C supplementation may slightly shorten the duration of a cold. That being said, there are multiple benefits from the foods that naturally contain vitamin C, and I would still focus on those first.</p>
