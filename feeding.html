                     Babies require different amounts of breast milk, formula, and solid food depending on their age, size, and appetite, which is where a baby feeding chart can come in handy for new parents.
                    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Unless your baby's pediatrician advises you otherwise, one of the most important things you can do is listen to your infant's hunger and fullness cues to guide feedings, rather than sticking to a specific amount or a strict feeding schedule.

Read on to learn general baby feeding guidelines by age and get a handy baby feeding chart for quick reference.

                    <h2>Newborn and Baby Feeding Chart</h2>
                    <p>
                      Babies should be fed whenever they seem hungry (aka "on demand").1 This feeding pattern can vary a lot from baby to baby and over time. While each baby's feeding needs may be slightly different, most will follow a relatively predictable schedule.
                      In the baby feeding chart below, you'll find the average amounts of breast milk or formula that babies consume at each feeding by age.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                    In the first several weeks of life, newborns typically eat every two to three hours. By 2 months, babies will usually feed every three to four hours, and by 6 months old, the time between feedings commonly stretches to every four to five hours.
                   </p>
                   <h2>Feeding Schedule for Newborns</h2>
                   <p>Newborns should receive all of their calories from breast milk or baby formula. Here's a breakdown of typical newborn feeding patterns.</p>


                    <div class="highlight-box">
                      <h3>Breast milk</h3>
                     <p>
                      Most newborns eat every two to three hours and drink 1 to 2 ounces of breast milk per feeding.1 When your baby reaches 2 weeks old, this amount slowly increases over time.

                      If you're pumping and bottle-feeding, you'll be able to see how much milk your baby is consuming each feeding, but if you're nursing directly from the breast, it's much more difficult to measure your infant's intakeâ€”and that's OK.

                        Try gauging their intake by watching their output. You can tell your little one is eating enough if they wet their diaper two to three times per day in the first few days, and then five to six times a day after they're 4 or 5 days old.
                     </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Formula</h2>
                    <p>
                       A formula-fed newborn will take about 1 to 2 ounces per feeding in the first week, gradually increasing to 3 to 4 ounces at each feeding by the end of the first month. Formula-fed infants tend to eat every three to four hours, and they're more likely to be on a predictable feeding schedule than breastfed infants.2
                        How much and how often to feed infant formula? Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2024.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As a rule of thumb, aim to feed your baby 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body weight daily, says Amy Lynn Stockhausen, MD, an associate professor of general pediatrics and adolescent medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. While this is a good rule of thumb, it's more important to listen to your infant's cues rather than strictly giving them a specific amount of formula on a strict schedule.
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                      <h3>Newborn Feeding Tip</h3>
                      <p>During the first few weeks, if your baby doesn't wake up in the middle of the night to eat, you should wake them. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends waking newborns to eat after four to five hours of sleep in the first few weeks after birth if they don't wake on their own.</p>
                      
                    
                    </div>

                    

                    <h2>1- to 3-Month-Old Feeding Schedule</h2>
                    <p>
                      How much should a 3-month-old eat? What about babies who are 1 month or 2 months old? Here's what to expect: Between 1 and 3 months, your baby's appetite will increase, and they'll become more vocal about telling you when they're hungry. The AAP says that a 2-month-old baby will usually eat 4 to 5 ounces every three to four hours.<br>

                      If you're feeding formula, you might want to look for one supplemented with 2'-FL HMO. These human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are naturally found in breast milk, and research has found that they act as a prebiotic, supporting babies' gut health and immune system development.3 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has categorized three HMOs, including 2'-FL, as generally regarded as safe.4
                    </p>
                    <h2>4- to 6-Month-Old Feeding Schedule</h2>
                    <p>
                      Most babies are ready to start solids around 6 months of age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).5 However, since all babies are different, your child may follow a slightly different timeline. So, how can you know when your baby is ready?<br>
                      Babies who are ready to try solids tend to show some signs, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Demonstrating good head and neck control</li>
                      <li>Sitting up without support</li>
                      <li>Losing the tongue-thrust reflex that automatically pushes food out of their mouth</li>
                      <li>Mastering the grabbing skill</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>
                      Babies younger than 4 months have not developed these necessary skills, so don't start solids before 4 months. When first introducing solids, aim to offer your little one about 1 to 2 tablespoons of food twice daily.6<br>

                      Remember that even after introducing solids, breast milk or formula is still your baby's primary food source for their entire first year of life. Babies should still drink about 4 to 6 ounces per feeding when they're 4 months old. Once they reach 6 months old, they may take even moreâ€”up to 8 ounces every four or five hours.
                     </p>

                    </div>




                    <h2>6- to 9-Month-Old Feeding Schedule</h2>
                    <p>
                      When a baby is 6 to 9 months old, nearly all their calories should still come from breast milk or formula, says Natalie Muth, MD, RDN, a pediatrician, registered dietitian, and co-author of The Picky Eater Project. For a formula-fed baby at this age, that usually means up to 32 ounces of formula daily<br>

                      Your breastfed baby's nursing patterns may fluctuate at this age due to growth spurts or needing extra comfort. That's why it remains important to watch for hunger cues rather than sticking to strict feeding schedules and limits. If you notice your child isn't nursing as often after introducing solids, the CDC recommends offering breast milk before feeding them a meal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Since your baby is still getting most of their calories from breast milk or formula, don't stress about getting them to eat bite after bite of solid food. You can offer your child food whenever you sit down to eat. At this point, solids are more about the ritual and exposure than nutrition (though it's still important to offer nutritious options!). At this age, you can offer foods such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Iron-fortified single-grain baby cereal</li>
                      <li>Pureed foods, including vegetables, fruits, and meats</li>
                      <li>Finger foods like soft vegetables and fruit</li>
                      <li>Yogurt</li>
                      <li>Cottage cheese</li>
                      <li>Casseroles</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>
                      If your baby seems to have an insatiable appetite or doesn't seem to be eating enough, contact a health care provider for advice.
                     </p>
                    

                     <h2>9- to 12-Month-Old Feeding Schedule</h2>
                     <p>
                      At this age, babies should continue having about 7 to 8 ounces of breast milk or formula per feeding. They usually cap out at 32 ounces of formula in 24 hours. "By 9 to 12 months, about half of your baby's calories should come from food and the other half from breast milk or formula," says Dr. Muth.
                      <br>Growing infants tend to have an adventurous palate. They've learned food tastes good, so don't be afraid to give them baby-friendly nibbles from your plate. If they want more, feed them more, but if they push food away, don't take it personally.

                      <br>Babies like to play with their food, so also consider using yogurt or oatmeal as a dip for vegetables or whole-grain crackers. Just remember to ensure foods are prepared safely and avoid those that are small, round, hard, or the size of a child's airway (these can be choking hazards).8

                     <h2>
                      Feeding Schedule After 12 Months
                     </h2>
                     <p>

                      After their first birthday, most of the calories your baby consumes should come from table food, says Dr. Muth. To meet their calcium needs, consider serving whole cow's milk in an open cup at meals and with snacks.  <br>

The US Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that toddlers get 700 milligrams of calcium per day (the equivalent of 2 to 3 cups of milk a day), but it's important to note that it doesn't have to come from cow's milk.9  <br>
Dietary Guidelines for Americans. US Department of Agriculture. 2020.


Aiming for a set meal and snack schedule can also pay off since your child will be hungrier and potentially more willing to try new things at this age. Always consult a health care provider if you're unsure about feeding guidelines for your baby.
